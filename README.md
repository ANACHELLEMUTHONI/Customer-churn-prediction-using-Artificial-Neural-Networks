# Customer-churn-prediction-using-Artificial-Neural-Networks
This project utilizes machine learning by using tensor flow to predict the customer churn of a telecom service based on the dataset provided.
It is more expensive to attract new customers than to retain existing ones.
Here are the steps followed in order:
1. Understanding the problem.
2. Data collecction and exploration.
3. Data splitting
4. Building artificial neural network
5. Training the model
6. Model evaluation
7. Interpretation and deployment
8. Documentation and reporting
9. Writing a tecnical article on the findings and the conclusions of the project
